# Readable

This is a React/Redux practice app implemented as the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course. 

Readable is a content and comment web app (think: Reddit). Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the frontend client and the backend API Server.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install` or `yarn`
    - `node server` or `yarn start`
* In another terminal window, start the local front-end server
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install` or `yarn`
    - `npm start` or `yarn start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
